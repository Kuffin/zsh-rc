Zshrc
=====

My personalized `zshrc`.
Just copy it in the home directory under the name `.zshrc`.

I also modified the agnoster theme of oh-my-zsh. If you want to use it, copy it
in the `themes` folder of oh-my-zsh and include this one in the `zshrc`.


*This zshrc is based on [ImmanuelHaffner](https://github.com/ImmanuelHaffner/zsh-rc)'s zshrc*
